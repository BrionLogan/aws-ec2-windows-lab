# üöÄ AWS EC2 Windows Instance Lab

## üìå Overview
This lab demonstrates launching, configuring, and connecting to a **Windows EC2 instance** in AWS.  
It was completed from **macOS** using the Microsoft Remote Desktop app, showcasing AWS fundamentals, secure remote access, and basic Windows Server operations.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites
- **AWS Account** ‚Äì Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) to provision cloud resources.
- **Mac Computer** ‚Äì Running macOS with internet access.
- **Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac** ‚Äì Download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466) to connect to the Windows EC2 instance.
- **AWS Key Pair (.pem)** ‚Äì Required to decrypt the Administrator password for your EC2 instance.

## üìÇ Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Launching the EC2 Instance
- **AMI:** *Microsoft Windows Server (Free tier eligible)*  
  *Reasoning:* Windows Server was selected to practice RDP connections and basic server management in a cloud environment.
- **Instance Type:** `t2.micro` (free tier eligible)  
  *Reasoning:* Sufficient CPU and memory for a basic Windows server lab without incurring extra costs.
- **Network Settings:**
  - Used the default **VPC** and **subnet**.  
    *Reasoning:* The default VPC is preconfigured for internet access, which simplifies setup for a beginner lab.
  - Created a **custom security group** allowing only **RDP (TCP 3389)** from **my IP address**.  
    *Reasoning:* Restricting RDP access to a single IP follows the principle of least privilege and improves security.
- **Storage:**
  - Kept the default **8 GB gp3 EBS root volume**.  
    *Reasoning:* 8 GB is enough for the operating system and basic testing while keeping storage costs minimal.
- **Key Pair:**
  - Generated and downloaded a `.pem` key during instance creation.  
    *Reasoning:* This private key is required to decrypt the Windows Administrator password before first connection.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting from macOS via RDP
- Downloaded Microsoft Remote Desktop from the Mac App Store.  
  *Reasoning:* This free tool from Microsoft is the standard for connecting to Windows systems from macOS.
- In the AWS console:
  - Selected the instance ‚Üí **Connect** ‚Üí **RDP Client**.
  - Downloaded the `.rdp` file.  
    *Reasoning:* The `.rdp` file contains preconfigured settings to simplify the connection process.
  - Clicked **Get Password** ‚Üí uploaded the `.pem` key file ‚Üí decrypted the Administrator password.  
    *Reasoning:* This step ensures that only someone with the correct private key can access the instance.
- Opened the `.rdp` file in Microsoft Remote Desktop and logged in using the decrypted password.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying the Instance
- Created a folder named `LabTest` on the Windows desktop.  
  *Reasoning:* Demonstrates direct interaction with the instance and verifies that the connection was successful.
- The `LabTest` folder screenshot also includes the EC2 Instance ID, confirming the link between the AWS console and the RDP session.
